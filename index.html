			<h1>
				Hello,<br />
				I'm Herman<br />
				Lederer
			</h1>
			<p>
				Ever since I have first seen a computer, I have taken interest
				in digital technology. I played a lot of computer games in my
				childhood, but it was not until my third year in elementary
				school that I really started digging deeper and trying to find
				out how all these games I loved were made. I did not have any
				real ways to learn that until I changed the school when I was in
				the sixth grade and found out that there was a programming club
				in my new school. I joined as soon as I got a chance to and
				thus, my journey into game development began. I learned HTML,
				then JavaScript, then C++, Pascal, and Java. I've taken a number
				of courses outside the school and became even more passionate
				about game programming then before.
			</p>
			<p>
				Right now I am studying game design at Hanze University of
				Applied Sciences, working on countless projects, some of which
				are presented in this portfolio, acquiring new design and
				development skills and coming closer and closer to my goal of
				becoming a professional game developer.
